We are asking that everyone RSVP by Sept. 15 so we can give an accurate count to our caterer.  Please make sure your response card is in the mail before the deadline!  If we don\'t hear from you by the deadline, you will probably receive a frustrated phone call or e-mail.  You have been warned. </p> </div> <h3>Save the Dates</h3> <div> <p> We hope you enjoyed them!  Kat\'s brother did the design, and we think he did a fantastic job.
